Our story began in 2011 during our first year at university. We spent a nerdy week together at engineering camp and stayed close friends for the next 5 years. Friendship turned into something more one romantic day in Seattle, and since then, we have been inseparable. From travelling the world together, buying our first home, and moving to Vancouver in 2019, it's been a wonderful and wild ride so far. In July 2020, on a trip to beautiful Lake Louise in Banff, Tom romantically proposed and now we can't wait to spend the rest of our lives together. ❤️💍
